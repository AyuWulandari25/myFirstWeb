            The increase in the use of agricultural chemicals has led to the emergence of many problems that were not previously faced by the environmental pollution in all its aspects, including the presence of these chemicals in food, which will reach the consumer levels may not be acceptable according to the standards adopted, especially when working in ways that do not meet the conditions of optimal use of agricultural chemicals. Scientific advances and the development of methods of analysis and detection of chemicals have been an important factor in highlighting the issue of residues of agrochemicals in food, prompting countries to issue strict legal legislation on food safety to ensure consumer safety. The severe fear of the residues of pollutants in food, especially in the sixties during the agricultural revolution and the increase of chemicals used in agricultural production and food processing, and to reduce this problem prompted specialists to introduce new farming systems or concepts began work on the principle of integrated pest control and developed towards the trend of organic farming and These methods of agricultural production, which aim to reduce the use of these chemicals to the maximum extent and may be confiscated not to use as well as organic agriculture, in addition to it focuses on recycling of waste in the agricultural system.The most important crops are organically grown vegetables (potatoes, onions, garlic, beans, peppers, cucumbers, cantaloupe, strawberries, tomatoes, carrots, pea and squash) and fruit (apricots, peaches, apples, dates) Field crops, fiber (cotton, peanuts and sesame) and also medicinal and aromatic herbs.

            Organic farming refers to agricultural production systems used to produce food and fiber. Organic farming management relies on developing biological diversity in the field to disrupt habitat for pest organisms, and the purposeful maintenance and replenishment of soil fertility. Organic farmers are not allowed to use synthetic pesticides or fertilizers. All kinds of agricultural products are produced organically, including produce vegetable crops, grains, meat, dairy, eggs, flowers, and processed food products. Some of the essential characteristics of organic systems include: design and implementation of an "organic system plan" that describes the practices used in producing crops and livestock products; a detailed recordkeeping system that tracks all products from the field to point of sale; and maintenance of buffer zones to prevent inadvertent contamination by synthetic farm chemicals from adjacent conventional fields.

            The concept of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) has evolved in recent years in the context of a rapidly changing and globalizing food economy and as a result of the concerns and commitments of a wide range of stakeholders regarding food production and security, food safety and quality, and the environmental sustainability of agriculture. These stakeholders represent actors from the supply dimension (farmers, farmersâ€™ organizations, workers), the demand dimension (retailers, processors and consumers) and those institutions and services (education, research, extension, input supply) that support and connect demand and supply and who seek to meet specific objectives of food security, food quality, production efficiency, livelihoods and environmental conservation in both the medium and long term.
