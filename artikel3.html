            <h5>Shrimp Farm Syarikat Warisan Hikmat Sdn. Bhd., Kota Belud, Sabah</h5>
                <p>
                    Warisan Hikmat was awarded with the MyGAP certification and Fish Quality Certificate in 2009. It is the first farm in Sabah and among the earliest farms to receive these certifications in Malaysia, which allowed it to export prawn products to the European Union. Wah Keng Jieng started the farm with two ponds for tiger prawn aquaculture in 1998. He later found huge potential in raising white shrimp, building 36 ponds on more than 18 hectares of land. Given the high demand in Europe and other markets, the farm increased the number of ponds to 76.
                    The MyGAP and farm-based biosecurity procedure saved Warisan Hikmat from the early mortality syndrome or EMS outbreak in 2013 and 2014. Following the MyGAP standard has helped the farm ensure product quality and sustainability, which it needs to compete in the international market. Good farming practices also increased its production to 1,800 tons per year since 2009 from 1,200 tons before the certification. It plans to raise production further to 2,000 tons per year

            <h5>Seaweed Cluster Kg. Lok Buton, Semporna, Sabah</h5>
                <p>
                    The seaweed cluster of Lok Buton in the waters of Semporna district in Sabah was introduced to local villagers in 2012. The objective of this cluster system is poverty alleviation: to help poor communities in the Lok Buton area and in the e-Kasih (the national poverty data bank) to undertake the cluster planting projects.Lok Buton has an area of more than 60 hectares. The Sabah Fisheries Department divided the area among the 50 participants, each receiving 1 hectare.Good aquaculture practices in seaweed culture have improved seaweed production and have earned MyGAP certification for 48 participants. For example, the seaweed seed preparation system in Lok Buton uses special tables that have shortened preparation time and reduced pressure on the seed, which is a factor in ensuring the good quality of products.MyGAP certification has opened markets for seaweed and raised the value of the products. The income of each participant has increased to an average of 2,500 ringgits (nearly $600) per month from less than 350 ringgits monthly.

            <h5>Poh Lian Plantation Sdn. Bhd., Samarahan, Sarawak</h5>  
                <p>
                    The 51-hectare Poh Lian Plantation is the largest farm for leafy vegetables to receive the MyGAP seal in Sarawak, where more than 140 farms have been certified.Located at Serian, Asajaya, and Sadong Jaya in Samarahan, Poh Lian is also involved in the wholesale distribution of its produce. It grows 15 types of leafy vegetables, including chai sim, bong kim pek, siaw pek chai, Chinese Lettuce, kiew chai, kai chai, pak choy, kai lan, cangkok manis, kang kong, bayam, and lettuce. It uses the block planting system, which makes its vegetables traceable to its farms or farm block. Its products bear the farm registration numbers. In 2018, it produced about 280,000 metric tons of leafy vegetables and sold certified quality vegetables through supermarkets in Kuching, Samarahan, and Serian.Following the advice of the Agriculture Department, Poh Lian is reducing pesticide use and practices integrated pest management.
                    Poh Lian employs 30 workers (locals and foreigners) in four farms and a processing center in Sarawak. The welfare of workers is protected in the farm. All plantation workers must use protective clothing when handling pesticides. Workers are provided living quarters with standard facilities. They are also given proper job training.

            <h5>Sustainable Bird’s Nest House Project, Sarawak</h5>
                <p>
                    Sarawak has been exporting bird’s nests as raw or processed products since the 1960s but started swiftlet house farming only in early 2000. The state requires licenses to build and maintain any structure for swiftlet farming, permits for bird’s nest trading, and compliance with environmental protection guidelines. No town land or sub-urban land can be used.In addition to permits and licenses, the state is promoting MyGAP certification for swiftlet farming operators. So far, 121 swiftlet houses have been certified. Five processing plants are accredited to export to the PRC.The government is also promoting the use of RFID tags to easily track the product from the source to the consumer. And it can extend assistance on simple bird house construction.Swiftlet farming is generally sustainable because it requires a one-off capital investment and no special feeding. Operators need to regularly check the controlled environment inside the bird houses, especially temperature, humidity, ventilation, and the birds’ sound system. The potential monthly income per farm family is between 3,000 and 4,000 ringgits.

            <h5>Kilan Agriculture Park, Labuan Federal Territory</h5>
                <p class="last">
                    Fruit orchards use soil conservation methods, such as terracing, to ensure the soil structure is protected from erosion. Pesticide use is prohibited to maintain the natural environment and to keep the stingless bee safe. Stingless beekeeping is a top attraction in the park and the bees also play a major role in crop pollination.The Department of Agriculture Labuan provides a 3-hectare plot complete with irrigation system known as taman kekal pengeluaran makanan (TKPM, or The Permanent Food Park Programme) to committed and dedicated individuals practicing open fertigation planting systems.The TKPM plot was developed in 2015 for the land preparation phase. In 2016, irrigation infrastructure and systems were developed and began operation in 2017. Two participants maintain the area. The program aims to establish a permanent food crop production zone in the Federal Territory of Labuan, which will help increase the production of sustainable and quality food for the country. In addition, it is expected to develop and enhance the involvement of entrepreneurs in commercial food crop production. TKPM Kilan is seeking MyGap certification, which emphasizes food safety and the production of fresh food.
